  <p class="pairtext"><b>Pair programming</b> consits of two programmers who continuously work together with two different roles that alternates regularly. One of the roles is called the <i>driver</i> and the other one the <i>navigator</i>. They are using one workstation where the driver is writing the code and the navigator is reviewing the progress. This agile method has both its advantages and disadvantages. Ulitamtely it is used for more efficiency, knowledge and skills will be shared and fewer mistakes will be made. Some of challenges that comes with it are communication and engagement. If the two programmers are not actively engaging then it wouldn't be effective at all. </p>
